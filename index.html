      <h2>Why Vacations are Important for Everyone</h2>
    </section>
    <article>
      <h3>Stress Reduction</h3>
      <p>
        Vacations are a great stress reliever and are great for building relationships with those you love. The stress of work and daily responsibilities can overwhelm anyone. A well-planned vacation can help reduce irritability and those nagging health conditions like twitching eyelids, sore necks, and headaches.

      <h3>Relationship Building</h3>
      <p>
        Everyday responsibilities often get in the way of mindful communication with our loved ones. Vacations open up time that can be used to create memorable moments.

      <h3>Cultural Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you are travelling to distant locations or staying near your home, you can experience different cultures and learn things you never knew. Be open to new experiences and meeting new people.

      <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
      <p>There are many ways to implement mindfulness while on vacation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do everything at a slower pace (walking, eating, speaking). This will help you enjoy everything a bit more.</li>
        <li>Open your eyes and ears and pay attention to what you see and hear. You may see and hear new things.</li>
        <li>Sit down to eat your meal, especially if travelling with people you love. This opens time to talk about things you don't usually talk about.</li>
        <li>Be brave and try new things and talk to new people. This helps you get out of your everyday thought patterns.</li>
      </ul>
