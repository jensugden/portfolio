    <p class="min-width">Camping in a tent, a trailer, or under the open sky can be a cost-effective means to vacationing.
      Investing in this kind of equipment can have long-term benefits. The initial cost can be daunting,
      but your investment will last for many years of cared for properly, and can give you joy for decades.
      Compare to the cost of vacationing at resorts with fees that you won't be able to re-use.</p><br>
